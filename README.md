# Multi-purpose-robot-car
I have done this project as a part of my collage work 
This project has three modules in it and are integrated together and can be switched between modules 
The modules are:
Obstacle avoiding
line following and
maually controlled robot with live feed
the car can be used in three ways as mention above and I used telegram as a medium of switching between different modules
